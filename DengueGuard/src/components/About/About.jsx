            <p>
              Dengue fever is considered as a significantly growing health
              challenge in Sri Lanka. The current reactive approach taken to
              mitigate dengue disease leads to delayed detection and response
              which allows the disease to spread rapidly.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p>
              DengueGuard, an AI powered and community driven web platform
              designed to transform dengue mitigation from a reactive to a
              proactive approach.
            </p>
            <br></br>
            <p> DengueGuard provides the ability to
              citizens to report dengue breeding grounds and suspected symptoms,
              access heatmaps and engage with an AI chatbot for prevention
              advice. Health Officers utilises a web dashboard to manage citizen
              reports, view heatmap and send special announcements to citizens.
